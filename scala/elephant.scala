// A (hopefully) quick Scala exercise. Some input values and functions
// are defined for you, while others will need to be filled in. Any method or
// test value with a '???' is expected to be replaced with an implementation,
// otherwise a NotImplementedError is thrown

// It's recommended to run this sample in an IntelliJ or Eclipse worksheet,
// although it can also be completed within the Scala REPL as well

// Note that the the 'assert' test lines are provided to help assist you with
// the expected results of your implementation. Note that in the worksheet
// when they execute successfully they will look like 'res0: Unit = ()'
//
// You may add or replace any of the tests as desired, but please include
// comments as to why you're doing so (e.g., you can convince me you have a
// better implementation than the tests expect)

// This is the input corpus we'll be working with. Our goal is to
// programmatically determine the unique count of words of the input
